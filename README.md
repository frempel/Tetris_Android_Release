# Tetris_Android_Release

This release is for demo purposes only.

A basic Tetris application made for Android. Aside from the game itself, it features a score history, high score tracking, and basic options to adjust game speed. The Tetromino pieces fall as individual entities, not simply shifting all the blocks down by the number of lines cleared.

Potential features to add in the future:
* Hold piece functionality
* More localization
* Option for gesture controls
* Implementing the full Super Rotation System
